## 🎭 Demo Script

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"Today I'll demonstrate the Codebase Time Machine - a tool that analyzes Git repositories to understand how code evolves over time. This tool answers questions like 'How has our authentication system changed?' or 'Who contributed most to this feature?'"*

### **Main Interface Tour (1 minute)**
1. **Point out the hero section** - Clean, professional design
2. **Scroll to features** - Highlight the 4 main capabilities:
   - Git Analysis
   - AI Queries  
   - Visualizations
   - Business Context

### **Live Analysis Demo (3-4 minutes)**

#### Option A: Quick Demo (2 minutes)
1. **Click "Try Demo"** button
2. **Select "Hello World (Simple)"** 
3. **Click "Quick Analysis"**
4. **Show real-time progress bar** - "Notice the live updates"
5. **When complete, explore results page**

#### Option B: Custom Repository (4 minutes)
1. **Use the main analysis form**
2. **Enter a repository URL** (suggestions below)
3. **Enable "Full Analysis"** 
4. **Show progress updates**
5. **Explore comprehensive results**

### **Natural Language Queries Demo (2 minutes)**
Once analysis is complete:
1. **Try example queries:**
   - "Who are the main contributors?"
   - "What patterns were introduced?"
   - "Show me how authentication evolved"

2. **Show instant responses** in natural language

### **Visualizations Demo (2 minutes)**
1. **Open the interactive ownership chart** - New tab/window
2. **Demonstrate interactivity** - Hover, zoom, filter
3. **Show comprehensive analysis** results

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
*"The Codebase Time Machine provides insights that would take hours to gather manually, delivered in minutes through an intuitive web interface. It's perfect for code reviews, understanding legacy systems, and tracking technical debt."*

- Have backup screenshots ready

### **If Repository Fails:**
- Have 2-3 backup repositories ready
- Public repositories work best
- Avoid very large repositories for live demos

### **If Questions Come Up:**
- **"How long does it take?"** - Depends on repository size, 30 seconds to 5 minutes
- **"What languages are supported?"** - All major languages for change tracking, Python for detailed metrics
- **"Can it work with private repos?"** - Yes, with local cloning or proper access tokens
- **"How accurate are the insights?"** - Based on Git history, commit messages, and code analysis

## 🎪 Advanced Demo Features

### **For Technical Audiences:**
1. **Show the database** - Open `codebase_analysis.db` with a SQLite browser
2. **Demonstrate API calls** - Use browser dev tools or Postman
3. **Show mobile responsiveness** - Resize browser window

### **For Business Audiences:**
1. **Focus on insights** - Skip technical details
